# Aflightreservationsystem

A flight reservation system typically allows users to book, cancel, and manage flight bookings. Below is a simple implementation of such a system in C, along with the project description.

**Project Description:
Title: Flight Reservation System**

Objective: The system will provide a simple interface where users can:

View available flights.
Book a flight.
Cancel a booking.
View booking details.
The system will store the flight data (like flight ID, flight name, departure, and arrival cities, seat availability) in a simple array structure. For simplicity, we won't use file handling in this basic version, but it can be extended.

**Features:**

Display available flights.
Book a flight.
Cancel a flight booking.
View all current bookings.
